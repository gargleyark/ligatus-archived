		"Slips used to attach a case-cover or boards in which either the two elements of a double supports or a single slip split into two are laced into boards or out of case-covers through a single hole and return through two separate holes, one at approximately 45 degrees above and the other at 45 degrees below the first hole. Split lacing was a common feature of many medieval bindings but becomes a particularly typical feature of Spanish laced-case bindings in the 17th century, even to the extent where the appearance is created in alum-tawed skin which is not attached to any of the sewing supports."@en .
