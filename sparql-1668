Some bindings which are entirely covered in metal have edge flaps which are hinged to the edges of the metal cover. Edge flaps are most often more or less rigid, but limp edge flaps are known, and may be used also as a form of fastening by means of holes cut in the edge of the flap which fit over edge pins on the opposite board to the one to which the flap is attached." , "@language" : "en" } ] }
