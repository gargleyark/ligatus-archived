		"The process of holding bookblocks together by stabbing a material such as thread, textile tape, parchment or tanned or tawed skin thongs through the inner margin of an entire bookblock (see also stitching in blocks). Stitching is such a simple technique that it was used both formally and informally from a very early date, but was recognised as a cheap and inferior alternative to sewing, and attempts were made in England in 1586 to control its use in order to protect the work of the bookbinders."@en .
