    <skos:scopeNote xml:lang="en">The separate groups of threads visible on the outside of pierced support(s) on the spines of longstitch bindings can be described as longstitch sets. A longstitch binding therefore with two sewing stations will have one set and one with three stations will have two sets. However, a binding with four stations can have either two or three sets, and so on.</skos:scopeNote>
