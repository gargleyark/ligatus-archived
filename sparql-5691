	skos:scopeNote	"Narrow strips of tanned, oil-tanned or alum-tawed skin used for a variety of purposes in bookbindings, such as sewing supports, endband cores, ties, etc. Although the terms &#039;thongs&#039; and &#039;tapes&#039; are very similar in meaning, thongs are typically thicker than tapes made from animal skins. Therefore a length of thin animal skin used for the secondary braiding of an endband should be described as a tape rather than a thong."@en .
