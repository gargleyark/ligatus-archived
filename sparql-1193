Crowning cores were a common feature of Italian bindings of the renaissance, hence their sometimes being known as &#039;renaissance endbands&#039;. At that date the crowning cores were attached by means of the secondary sewing, but from the early seventeenth century, from which date they become a common feature of more expensive bindings across Europe, they were incorporated into the primary sewing."@en .
