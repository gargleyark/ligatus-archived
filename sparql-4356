    <skos:scopeNote xml:lang="en">Tackets, typically found at the head and tail of individual gatherings, that were used to hold the individual bifolia within a gathering together without a cover. These were often used during the medieval period to secure the bifolia as the manuscript was being written but were also occasionally used on incunabula for reasons as yet unclear. </skos:scopeNote>
