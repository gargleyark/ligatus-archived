Separate pastedowns may be original to the binding, but could be added at a later date to a binding without pastedowns to hide the exposed inner surface of the boards. Separate pastedowns are often found in British bindings of the mid-seventeenth century, and are particularly associated with low and medium quality bindings. They may be made of either plain or decorated paper."@en .
