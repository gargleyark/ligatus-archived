Ties that are now missing but which were originally brought around the edge of the turn-in can often be recognised by the crushing of the edge as the tie was pulled tight. Occasionally, French binders, who made regular use of this type of tie, would indent a wide turn-in to create narrower sections to allow the ties to be pulled around the edges of the turn-ins." , "lang" : "en" } ] }
