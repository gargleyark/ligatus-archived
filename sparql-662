    <skos:scopeNote xml:lang="en">Tanned skin decorated with a pattern transferred by means of an engraved block which leaves a depressed pattern of darker leather in the paler un-stamped skin. The resulting leather will often have a somewhat embossed appearance. The material is often found as pastedowns in Islamic bindings and was also used for book bags in western Europe.</skos:scopeNote>
