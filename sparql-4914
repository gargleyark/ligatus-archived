In the latter case, both elements are stubs, though the outer element is usually wider than the inner (it may be up to half the width of the text leaves, beyond which it should be described as a leaf). Many single leaves, most often plates in the form of maps or illustrations, will also be folded around text gatherings with a stub on the other side of the fold." , "@language" : "en" } ] }
