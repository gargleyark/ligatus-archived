    <skos:scopeNote xml:lang="en">Subsidiary cores which sit on top of the main cores. Crowning cores were a common feature of Italian bindings of the renaissance, hence their sometimes being known as &amp;#039;renaissance endbands&amp;#039;. At that date the crowning cores were attached by means of the secondary sewing, but from the early seventeenth century, from which date they become a common feature of more expensive bindings across Europe, they were incorporated into the primary sewing.</skos:scopeNote>
