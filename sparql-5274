Stencilling and colouration can be repeated numerous times, with different colours and in addition to other decoration techniques like block-printing or metal-leaf embossing. Alternatively, small pieces of material such as grains of rice could be scattered over a piece of paper, usually already coloured, and sprinkling over them to create the decoration (scattered stencil)." , "@language" : "en" } ] }
