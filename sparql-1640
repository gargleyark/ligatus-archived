The color of the ruling is almost always red, now often faded to brown, particularly in the earlier continental books. The practice was usually reserved for large paper copies or special copies. Binders often carried out this work, which was most easily done before a book was bound, but professional rulers were also available for this work." , "@language" : "en" } ] }
