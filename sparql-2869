The portion of the hair outside of the skin is called the shaft. Fine, closely spaced hair that covers most of an animal&#039;s body is called fur. Dense, soft, curled hair is called wool. Coarse, stiff hairs are called bristles, spines, or quills. Horsehair and cattle hair have been used for brushes, plaster binders, haircloth, and upholstery stuffing.
