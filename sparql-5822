The tabs were intended to reinforce the sewing of the outermost gathering on each side, and can be seen between the two outermost gatherings, usually with one tab to each sewing station, but occasionally with one tab covering two adjacent sewing stations. This type of lining would appear to be south German, and is found on bindings made in the late fifteenth and early sixteenth centuries." , "@language" : "en" } ] }
