The slips are therefore visible on the outside of the cover along the joints, unless hidden by a secondary cover. Laced-case bindings were in use in Italy and France in the last quarter of the fifteenth century, but are found in every country of Europe in a myriad of different variations throughout the sixteenth century. In northern Europe they are rarely found after the middle of the seventeenth century, but their use continued for longer in the same century in Italy and until the early nineteenth century in Spain."@en ,
