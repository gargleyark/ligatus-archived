		"Paper coloured by adding one or more smooth applications or coatings of a mixture of a binder and pigment to one or both of its sides. These papers have a smooth, enamel-like surface, in which the colour does not penetrate the paper, and may present either a matt or glossy surface, the latter finish being obtained by burnishing or calendering. Some coated papers were embossed with a fine pattern such as moir\u00E9. Such papers do not appear to have been used before the 1820s."@en .
