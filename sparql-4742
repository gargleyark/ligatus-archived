Support stiffeners of copper alloy were recorded by Szirmai (Archaeology, pp 310-311) on printed books of the first half of the sixteenth century from Westphalia, but the use of stiffeners, including those made of wood, appears to have been a more general medieval archival practice." , "@language" : "en" } ] }
