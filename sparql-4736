    <skos:scopeNote xml:lang="en">A sewn endleaf guard found at the beginning and end of a bookblock which is not folded around the full leaves of the endleaf which are part of a separate unit. Separately-sewn endleaf guards would appear to be a particularly French phenomenon first found in the last quarter of the sixteenth century and surviving through to the beginning of the nineteenth.</skos:scopeNote>
