Grain will be found therefore in all types of timber and also in machine-made paper. The direction of the grain in a piece of wood runs vertically up the trunk of the tree and in most bindings with wooden boards the grain runs vertically in the board, but horizontally-grained boards will occasionally be found. The direction of the grain in a piece of machine-made paper runs along the length of the continuous sheet as it emerges from the papermaking machinery." , "@language" : "en" } ] }
