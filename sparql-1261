	skos:scopeNote	"A comb lining in which the lining is folded into a stub between the outermost and the next gathering at the joint, thus allowing the outermost gatherings to be sewn through the lining. It thus serves equally the functions both of a spine lining and an external sewing guard, but is classified here as a spine lining because of its similarity to a tabbed comb guard."@en .
