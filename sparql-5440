    <skos:scopeNote xml:lang="en">A longstitch technique which includes the winding of thread over, around and between groups of longstitch threads within individual sets on the outside of the spine, as a separate operation carried out on a book that is already sewn. This has a protective and tensioning effect for the longstitch threads but it could be used to decorative effect.</skos:scopeNote>
