Some folded leaf tab markers were folded tightly over the edges of the leaves, others project from the edge to a greater or lesser extent. The outer ends of some folded leaf tab markers were formed into turk&#039;s head knots. The inner ends only of leaf tab markers are sometime found preserved in books that have had their fore-edges cut as the result of rebinding. They may or may not be be numbered or lettered, and could be added at any time after a book was bound." , "lang" : "en" } ,
