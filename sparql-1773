	skos:scopeNote	"Eastern papers come in a wide variety of types that is sometimes difficult to distinguish with any accuracy. One of the more common types has polished, somewhat toned surfaces with a softer, fibrous interior. Often, eastern papers are very opaque and rather thick by comparison with western papers, and show no distinct laid pattern; others show quite coarse laid patterns."@en .
