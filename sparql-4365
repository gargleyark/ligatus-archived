    "http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#scopeNote" : [ { "type" : "literal", "value" : "A piece of sheet material which covers the spine and the spine edges of the boards under a full, half or quarter cover. A quarter lining may be cut to the height of or shorter than the boards, or be turned-in at head and tail. On an inboard binding, a quarter lining might perhaps be thought of as a primary cover, but as they are never found without some sort of cover over them, and are often found without turn-ins and even cut short of the full height of the boards, it is more logical to think of them as a lining to the cover, hence the term &#039;quarter lining&#039;. Quarter linings of paper were frequently used on British paper-covered inboard publishers&#039; or edition bindings of the last quarter of the eighteenth century and beginning of the nineteenth. A similar component was also used as a spine piece on some of the British versions of German three-piece cases of the second and third decades of the nineteenth century and may also be found on the earliest bindings covered in bookcloth in the 1820s." , "lang" : "en" } ] }
