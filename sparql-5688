    <skos:scopeNote xml:lang="en">Narrow strips of tanned, oil-tanned or alum-tawed skin used for a variety of purposes in bookbindings, such as sewing supports, endband cores, ties, etc. Although the terms &amp;#039;thongs&amp;#039; and &amp;#039;tapes&amp;#039; are very similar in meaning, thongs are typically thicker than tapes made from animal skins. Therefore a length of thin animal skin used for the secondary braiding of an endband should be described as a tape rather than a thong.</skos:scopeNote>
