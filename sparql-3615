	skos:scopeNote	"Metallic paper created by adhering sheets of metal leaf to papers that have already been coated with a bole or gesso. They can use metal leaves of pure gold or silver (gold leaf paper or silver leaf paper) or of a gold alloy (gold alloy paper). These papers were often burnished afterwards to produce a bright shine."@en .
