The term &#039;metal-leaf tooling&#039; can be used for any tooling using a metal leaf made from an alloy or a combination of different metals, but of which the exact composition is unknown. An unknown metal leaf can be described by its colour, such as gold-coloured metal leaf, silver-coloured metal leaf." , "lang" : "en" } ] }
