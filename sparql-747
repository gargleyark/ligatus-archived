The open edge may either be at the top (top-loading slip cases) or on one side (side-loading slip cases). The earliest English examples of side-loading slip cases date from the last quarter of the eighteenth century and have flexible leather sides (collapsible side-loading slip-cases). Entirely rigid, leather-covered top loading examples (rigid top-loading slip-cases) were used for fancy pocket books and almanacs from at least the mid-eighteenth century and, covered in printed and decorated paper, were widely used for such books in the early nineteenth century. They were also commonly used for folding maps." , "lang" : "en" } ] }
