Expanding gussets of paper, textile or tanned or alum-tawed skin were then inserted at the head and tail to create pockets for keeping notes in. Such pockets of sewn folded card with expanding gussets could also be used in conjunction with thicker boards, to which they were adhered, in a variety of structures. " , "@language" : "en" } ] }
