This technique could only be used on boards made from softer material than wood (paper, leather, parchment, etc), though thin sca&#039;boards could sometime have holes pushed through them, a process which usually resulted in the wood splitting along the grain on each side of the hole. Once a slip was laced through a pushed-through hole in a paper board, the hole would be closed around the slip by hammering it flat, thus locking the slip into the board." , "lang" : "en" } ] }
