    <skos:scopeNote xml:lang="en">Leaf markers made by making a vertical cut on the fore-edge to separate a strip of the leaf which is then folded back at right angle to the fore-edge, laced through a slot cut in the leaf so that it projects from the fore-edge. Leaf markers of this sort are most likely to be found on bookblocks with parchment leaves.</skos:scopeNote>
