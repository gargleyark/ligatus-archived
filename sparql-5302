The purpose of the springback is to cause the book to lie flat when open so as to facilitate its being written in across the spine. The springback acts as a spring, and its pressure on the sides of the book near the spine causes the book to snap open and shut. This technique was invented by the Englishmen John and Joseph Williams in  1799 and has been used ever since in the binding of large blankbooks. " , "@language" : "en" } ] }
