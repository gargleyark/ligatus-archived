    <skos:scopeNote xml:lang="en">Blocks bearing coats of arms, crests or other armorial achievements found most often on the sides of a binding. Some coats of arms on the sides of bindings were created by single handle tools, not blocks and care should be taken to identify the use of a block. Coats of arms found on the spines of books will be smaller than those on the sides and will have been created by the use of a handle tool rather than a block, as blocks can only be used on flat surfaces.</skos:scopeNote>
