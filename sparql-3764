    <skos:scopeNote xml:lang="en">The process of sewing groups of leaves to sewing supports in a process similar to stitching, but incoporating the sewing supports at the same time. A complete textblock may therefore have multiple oversewn groups of leaves. Oversewing is most often found on books consisting entirely of or with large numbers of single leaves.</skos:scopeNote>
