		"Clasp straps formed by a length of leather which is laced through a metal ring-type clasp, leaving an equal length on either side of the clasp. The two halves of the strap are then laced through each other through pre-punched holes, creating a strap with a marked chevron-pattern. Such straps are most often found divided into three separately interlaced elements (triple interlaced straps), but double and single straps will also be found. Such straps are typical of Greek-style bindings and have often been described as plaited, though the technique used is actually not a form of plaiting."@en .
