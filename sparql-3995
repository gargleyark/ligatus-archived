		"Whole or part sheets of printed material which were used in the construction of a binding. Spoiled printed sheets and unsold sheets from a printer&#039;s or bookseller&#039;s warehouse supplied most of this category of material, and its source may sometimes give clues as to the location and even identify the binder who used it."@en .
