    <skos:scopeNote xml:lang="en">A guard folded around the spine edge of the bookblock through which the gatherings are sewn. A full cover could then be folded over the pierced guard, or the pierced guard might be placed inside a full cover and both sewn through at the same time. Alternatively, a case might be attached to the pierced-guard sewing support by means of secondary tackets.</skos:scopeNote>
