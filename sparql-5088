    <skos:scopeNote xml:lang="en">Leather straps placed across the spine and attached to the spine edges of both boards to which copper alloy studs have been attached. A variant form can be found in which the copper alloy studs are linked one to another without a leather strap underneath. Such straps have been found on Swiss and Hungarian bindings and may be associated to the Mennonite church, both in Europe and North America.</skos:scopeNote>
