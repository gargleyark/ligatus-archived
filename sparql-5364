    <skos:scopeNote xml:lang="en">Clasps which are shaped out of a single thickness of sheet metal bent over at one end to form the hook. Cast hooked clasps will also have a single hook. When they are attached to the clasp strap they will usually have a metal plate (the back or rivet plate) on the other side to prevent the rivets used to attach them from pulling through the strap.</skos:scopeNote>
