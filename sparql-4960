    <skos:scopeNote xml:lang="en">Endbands secured to the bookblock by tiedowns of sewing thread taken down into the gatherings, which may or may not include a core, but are always worked separately from the main sewing of the bookblock. The sewing may be executed with a tiedown in each gathering across the spine or with only two tiedowns, one at each end, or anything in between. All should be described as sewn endbands.</skos:scopeNote>
