In its simplest form the strip of paper was cut to twice the width of the spine and was folded once only, creating a fold on one side of the spine only, the other side being left open. The more typical hollow was made from a piece of paper three times the width of the spine and folded twice, with one layer of paper on one side and two layers, adhered to each other, on the other."@en ,
