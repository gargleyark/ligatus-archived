Most often made of copper alloy, they will also be found made of iron as well as silver and silver-gilt, and will often be of the same design as the centre pieces. They can be decorated with punches, engraving, embossing, piercing, etc., and were made in a wide variety of shapes. Corners were used from the later middle-ages onwards, but increasingly, from the end of the sixteenth century, their function becomes more decorative and status-related. Some corners incorporate bosses which may be either hammered out of the corner itself (integral bosses) or as separate added components (separate bosses)." , "@language" : "en" } ,
