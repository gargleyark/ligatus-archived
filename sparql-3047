These components include the cover, the sewing supports slips, the endband slips, the stuck-on endband lining extensions, the spine lining extensions, and any components of the endleaves such as the strips of leather and cloth known confusingly also as joints which cross the joints of the binding to be adhered to the inside of the boards and/or cover."@en .
