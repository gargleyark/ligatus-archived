		"A scattering of small droplets of coloured stain or liquid pigment on the surface to be decorated. Sprinkling was traditionally carried out by striking a large brush charged with colour against an iron bar over the surface to be sprinkled (a cover or a bookblock edge), or, more recently, by rubbing a brush with short bristles dipped in the colour across a metal sieve or grid."@en .
