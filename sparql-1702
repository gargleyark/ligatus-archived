    <skos:scopeNote xml:lang="en">A narrow strip of sheet material, most often of parchment but sometimes of paper, folded lengthways and either sewn on its own or with other endleaf components, but not folded around a text gathering (see text guards). Endleaf guards are most often found folded around a paper endleaf fold, but may occasionally be found on the inside of a fold or outside an endleaf hook.</skos:scopeNote>
