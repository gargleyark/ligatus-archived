The earlier ones were nailed to the surface of the board over the covering material, but later ones might be found inserted under the covering material. The earlier type was often decorated with punched, stamped and embossed decoration. Raised-lip catchplates and clasps project above the surface of the board and were designed for books kept horizontally on shelves or sloping lectern-like shelves." , "@language" : "en" } ] }
