For papers blocked in multiple colours, the individual colours were printed one after another with a drying process in between each colour. They were very popular in Italy, where the Remondini family of Bassano in particular produced a wide range of designs in the eighteenth century, but were also made in most other European countries, including Germany, where they were known a \u2018Kattunpapiere\u2019, and France, where they were known as \u2018papiers dominot\u00E9s\u2019, with Rheims and Orl\u00E9ans as two of the major centres of production. Block-printed papers were often given additional decoration in the form of stencilled or free-hand applications of colours (hand-colouring), both of which could have been done before or after printing." , "lang" : "en" } ] }
