Primary sewing can also be worked around two main cores of the same diameter, known as double main cores. Double main cores were a common feature of Greek-style endbands, but were also used on some expensive bindings in the late-eighteenth century. From the late sixteenth century, main cores can be sewn with a subsidiary crowning core with primary sewing only." , "lang" : "en" } ] }
