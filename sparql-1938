    <skos:scopeNote xml:lang="en">Linings of enclosures such as slip-cases, pull-off cases, etc. usually made of coloured or decorated papers. In some cases the decorated paper used as an enclosure lining is also found used as endleaves in the book for which the enclosure was made, indicating that both were made by the same bookbinder.</skos:scopeNote>
