Cap cores have been recorded from the last quarter of the sixteenth century, used to reinforce the caps of books bound in boards with wide squares and/or thin covering materials. In the early twentieth century this technique was associated with stationery bindings with spring backs, and was known as &#039;setting the head [or tail] with cord&#039;."@en .
