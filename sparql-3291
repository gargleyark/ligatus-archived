Lettering pallets were mostly used for words that would be used over and over again such as &#039;TOME&#039; or the words from a title or the name of an author of multi-volume sets being bound in a single workshop. The term lettering pallet is sometimes used for a type-holder which should apply only to the tool designed to hold separate pieces of type."@en .
