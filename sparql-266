    <skos:scopeNote xml:lang="en">The process of creating backing joints usually to accommodate the boards of a book. Backing joints can come in a variety of shapes (quadrant, slight, square, angled). The process of backing can be carried out either by lacing the boards on tightly and pulling them shut or by means of a backing hammer applied to a bookblock locked up in a press.</skos:scopeNote>
