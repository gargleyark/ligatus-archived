    <skos:scopeNote xml:lang="en">Change-over stations formed by stabbing the thread through the inner margin of the gatherings sewn as a group in multi-section sewing. Stitched change-over stations have been recorded on British books printed in single folios and sewn seven-on on six supports or eight-on on seven supports, in which each gathering would otherwise be secured by only two to three centimetres of thread.</skos:scopeNote>
