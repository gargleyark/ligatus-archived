    <skos:scopeNote xml:lang="en">The sewing supports are arranged so as to create a longer panel below the sewing support at the bottom of the spine than the panels between the sewing supports and at the head. This arrangement is usually associated with the vertical storage of books in which equal spacing will make the tail-end panel look short.</skos:scopeNote>
