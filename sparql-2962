Inlays were more difficult to carry out than onlays and presumably therefore more expensive, but were very neat and elegant when well executed. With age, inlays of tanned skin can shrink back from the primary covering material, leaving gaps around their edges and revealing how they were made. This cannot happen with onlays, though they often lift from the surface of the primary cover in damp storage." , "@language" : "en" } ,
