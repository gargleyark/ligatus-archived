		"A cover in which primary covering material is found on the spine and fore-edges of the boards only. The sides may or may not be covered separately by a cover or decorated paper. Bindings with parchment on the spine and fore-edges were a feature of Oxford bindings in the 18th century, though they will be found more generally with leather in the early 19th century."@en .
