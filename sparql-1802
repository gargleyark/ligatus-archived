    <skos:scopeNote xml:lang="en">Single or groups of endleaf components sewn through the fold as a single &amp;#039;gathering&amp;#039;, which may be combined with further units to complete the endleaves. A single bifolium tipped to another endleaf unit (frequently a decorated paper added to a single or double fold of plain paper) should not be considered as separate endleaf units, each of which must be sewn individually to qualify as such.

The individually-sewn groups of leaves which make up the endleaves at either end of a bookblock. Each unit may consist of one or more endleaf components, folded one inside the other. Although many endleaves consist of a single endleaf unit, endleaves consisting of two or more endleaf units will be found. </skos:scopeNote>
