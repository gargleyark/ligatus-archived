    <skos:scopeNote xml:lang="en">Steep bevels created on the external surface of the spine-edges of wooden boards which start just above the top support and finish just below the bottom support, leaving the head and tail of the spine-edges of the boards square. This technique is often found on German bindings of the late 15th and early 16th century.</skos:scopeNote>
