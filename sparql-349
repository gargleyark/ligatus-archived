		"Woven textiles specifically designed for use as a covering material for books, with a filler (usually starch-based) intended to prevent adhesives striking through to the surface, which could also take colour and embossed decoration. The first examples, using a simple glazed textile, are found from the mid 1820&#039;s, but from 1830 onwards, they appear in a bewildering variety of grains and colours."@en .
