The property P3 has note allows for the description of this content model. In order to disambiguate which symbolic level is the carrier of the meaning, the property P3.1 has type can be used to specify the encoding (e.g. &quot;bit&quot;, &quot;Latin character&quot;, RGB pixel)." , "lang" : "en" } ] ,
