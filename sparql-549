	skos:scopeNote	"Any device which is used in order to mark temporarily or permanently particular leaves or passages of a book so that they can be easily retrieved by the user at a later time. They can be put into one of three major categories: movable, that is a marker which has one part permanently connected to a book and a movable part capable of being placed by a reader anywhere within a book; fixed, that is a marker which is permanently connected to a particular leaf and cannot be moved; and free, that is a loose piece of material which can be used as a marker without any permanent connection to a book. Books can often have multiple bookmarks of more than one type."@en ,
