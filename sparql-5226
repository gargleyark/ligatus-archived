They can be used straight or folded, and if the latter, may be folded over a core. The projecting edges of either type could be decorated with secondary endband sewing, braided with a thong or painted. Until the mid-eighteenth century, such linings will almost always extend beyond the width of the spine, with a lining extension at each side. From the mid-eighteenth century, small pieces of decorated paper or textile folded over lengths of thin cord were used as stuck-on endbands across Europe (except in Britain where these are not found until the nineteenth century). From the 1820s, small pieces of bookcloth could also be used for this purpose." , "@language" : "en" } ] }
