    <skos:scopeNote xml:lang="en">Where a piece of material, such as a cover, board or endleaf, which is not large enough for its purpose has been filled in with a separate piece of the same or a similar material. A cover therefore might consist of one piece of leather for the spine and one for each side in order to create a full cover of apparently the same material. This is distinct from patch material where some damage or loss has been made good.</skos:scopeNote>
