    <skos:scopeNote xml:lang="en">The border of the board is reduced in thickness around its edges by means of a gentle curve, which leaves the central part of the board flat. This was less expensive to execute than a full cushion, but also allowed the use of panel stamps to decorate the flat area in the centre.</skos:scopeNote>
