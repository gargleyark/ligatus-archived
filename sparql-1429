	skos:scopeNote	"Strictly speaking, a tanned calfskin with an impressed lattice pattern over its whole surface. This maybe done in the skin before it is used, but appears often to have been done after the book was covered and therefore would appear only on the sides and not on the spine. Although the skins of other animals can be diced, and have sometimes been described as diced calf the term should be reserved only for calfskins that have been treated in this way."@en .
