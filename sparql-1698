    <skos:scopeNote xml:lang="en">A type of secondary stitching in which thongs, usually alum-tawed, are stabbed through a bookblock at both head and tail before being laced through the cover. The lacing therefore occupies a position close to that of the endband slips. This type of secondary stitching was typically used in France and not in England.</skos:scopeNote>
