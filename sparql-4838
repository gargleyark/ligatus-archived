In some cases the splits will only extend to the width of the spine, in others, the slips at either left or right will be split beyond the width of the spine. This feature will normally indicate the direction of the sewing as the split slips will be found at the end of the sewing process rather than at the beginning." , "@language" : "en" } ] }
