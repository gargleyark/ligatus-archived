    <skos:scopeNote xml:lang="en">Slips attached to paper boards by threads sewn through both. This technique was used as early as the mid-fifteenth century in Italy, where it remained in use until the first quarter of the sixteenth century. Sewn slips have also been recorded in a Cambridge binding by the Unicorn binder of the 1490s with laminated boards of tanned calfskin and alum-tawed hairsheep.</skos:scopeNote>
