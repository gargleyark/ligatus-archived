    <skos:scopeNote xml:lang="en">The more closely spaced fine lines created in the thickness of laid paper, and visible as brighter lines when viewed by transmitted light. They are created by the thinner wires, usually parallel to the longer sides of the rectangular laid mould, and which are supported by the thicker wire lines, which lie at right-angles underneath them. The impressions of both sets of lines are often clearly visible in reflected light and particularly in raking light.</skos:scopeNote>
