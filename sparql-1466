    <skos:scopeNote xml:lang="en">The hole was created in the board with a drill. Drilled holes are usually associated with wooden boards and will result in a round hole, although different types of drill (drill bit, auger, gimlet, etc.) may have been used to make the hole. To achieve holes with an elongated profile, a second or even third hole may drilled adjacent to the first, and drilled holes may be finished, in such a way as to disguise, partially or completely, the original method used to make the hole.</skos:scopeNote>
