The height of the boards allow the endband cores to be taken onto the edges of the boards and to be sewn to them. This is a typical feature of Greek-style bindings, and these endbands are often described as Greek-style endbands, though the same structure can found on bindings from other middle-eastern countries (e.g. Armenia)."@en .
