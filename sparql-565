	skos:scopeNote	"Small, usually rectangular, pieces of leather, parchment, paper or textile, often coloured or decorated, or even metal, which are adhered to the fore-edges of the leaves of a bookblock in order permanently to mark the locations of specific passages in a text, beginnings of sections, etc. They can be pasted on one side of a leaf or, if folded, to both sides of a leaf. Some folded leaf tab markers were folded tightly over the edges of the leaves, others project from the edge to a greater or lesser extent. The outer ends of some folded leaf tab markers were formed into turk&#039;s head knots. The inner ends only of leaf tab markers are sometime found preserved in books that have had their fore-edges cut as the result of rebinding. They may or may not be be numbered or lettered, and could be added at any time after a book was bound."@en ,
