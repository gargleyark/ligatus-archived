This type, the most common form of loop tacket, is found on German, Low Country and Italian bindings throughout the period 1490-1560, but is perhaps more typical of Italian practice from the 1530s onwards. Parchment, alum-tawed skin and cord were all used to make this type of tacket." , "lang" : "en" } ] }
