    <skos:inScheme rdf:resource="http://w3id.org/lob/" />
    <skos:scopeNote xml:lang="en">A technique of tie-lacing in which the inner end of the tie is placed between the turn-in and the outside of the cover and is either brought through a hole or slot in a wide turn-in or over the edge of a narrow turn-in before being laced through the turn-in, its own inner end and the outside of the cover to form the tie. Ties that are now missing but which were originally brought around the edge of the turn-in can often be recognised by the crushing of the edge as the tie was pulled tight. Occasionally, French binders, who made regular use of this type of tie, would indent a wide turn-in to create narrower sections to allow the ties to be pulled around the edges of the turn-ins.</skos:scopeNote>
