	skos:scopeNote	"The operation of tidying up the uneven edges of turn-ins on the inside of the boards or cover of a book. On many 16th-century bindings, the stains from the untrimmed turn-ins can be found on the endleaves and/or boards thus revealing exactly how much may have been cut away. The trimming can be done either with a straight or an oblique cut."@en ,
