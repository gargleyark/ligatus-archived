They can be cut either vertically, to make a horizontal pull-off box, or horizontally, to make a vertical pull-off box, and were often covered in leather with gold tooled \u2018spines\u2019 with false bands. They were often used for expensively-bound liturgica from the late seventeenth or early eighteenth century."@en .
