		"Alloy in which copper is the principle element. Brass is one of the most commonly-encountered copper alloys and is an alloy of copper and zinc, usually with copper as the major alloying element and zinc up to 40% by weight. Bronze will usually contain copper and a small amount of tin. Both brass and bronze are therefore copper alloys, and unless the alloy is known, it is safer to call both of them copper alloys."@en .
