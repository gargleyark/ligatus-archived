Stencilling can be repeated numerous times, with the same or different colours and in conjunction with other decoration techniques like block-printing or metal-leaf embossing. Another type of stencilling only occasionally encountered on paper involved scattering small pieces of material such as grains of rice or small chips of stone over a piece of paper, usually already coloured, and sprinkling over them to create the decoration (random stencil). This technique was much more often used for the decoration of bookblock edges." , "@language" : "en" } ] }
