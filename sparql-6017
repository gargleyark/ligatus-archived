Libraries first began storing books vertically in the sixteenth century when they began to run out of space for horizontal storage, and although a small number of books were stored spine outwards from the 1540s in Paris, initially most books were stored with their fore-edge outwards. In England, this practice, with a very few exceptions, lasted until the mid-seventeenth century." , "lang" : "en" } ] }
