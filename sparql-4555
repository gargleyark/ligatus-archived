Tanned and alum-tawed skin, parchment and paper were all used rolled, and the rolled paper cores sometimes have a length of cord, leather or other material adhered to the starting edge to make the process easier. Fifteenth-century Italian endband cores of alum-tawed skin rolled round thin cord have been recorded."@en .
