    <skos:scopeNote xml:lang="en">Cores made from lengths of thick alum-tawed or tanned skins split lengthways with a knife, often only across the width of the spine, and used without being twisted. These are found on some Romanesque bindings with the slips laced into wooden boards through tunnels drilled into the canted spine-edge corners of the boards.</skos:scopeNote>
