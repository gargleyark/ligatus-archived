Halfbands were originally created by single sewing supports (genuine halfbands) placed between larger double sewing supports on 15th-century German bindings, but by the 1480&#039;s the single supports began to be replaced by false bands (false halfbands), a practice found also in Italy in the mid-16th century."@en .
