		"The sewing support material is twisted. Cords, of course, will always be twisted, but skin materials were also twisted in order to give them an even, round cross section suited to sewing. It is not always possible to determine whether a core has been twisted or rolled when only a cut or broken cross section is visible, and in these cases it is safer to offer both options in the form &#039;twisted or rolled?&#039;."@en .
