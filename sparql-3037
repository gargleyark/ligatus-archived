They are found on both sides of the cover and were made to assist the easy opening of a case-cover by sharing the hingeing movement required of a cover with the joint crease. A cover opened to 180\u00B0 with only spine creases will make the cover material hinge through 180\u00B0 along one narrow line, subjecting the cover to a great deal of stress. By adding joint creases, the movement is shared, with each crease only hingeing through 90\u00B0, thus reducing the strain on the cover." , "lang" : "en" } ] }
