	skos:scopeNote	"A creased or scored line made from the outside of a cover from head to tail, parallel to the spine crease and a short distance from it towards the fore-edges of the cover. They are found on both sides of the cover and were made to assist the easy opening of a case-cover by sharing the hingeing movement required of a cover with the joint crease. A cover opened to 180\u00B0 with only spine creases will make the cover material hinge through 180\u00B0 along one narrow line, subjecting the cover to a great deal of stress. By adding joint creases, the movement is shared, with each crease only hingeing through 90\u00B0, thus reducing the strain on the cover."@en .
