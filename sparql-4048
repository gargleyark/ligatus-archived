    <skos:scopeNote xml:lang="en">Endbands that are attached to the spine of the bookblock by means of adhesive only. Stuck-on endbands will always have a strip of material, the stuck-on endband lining, which may be either single or folded, of which the edge, which projects beyond the end of the spine of the bookblock, may be decorated with thread, thong or paint. Stuck-on endbands may also have cores which can be laced into boards or covers. Their structural function is limited to that of a transverse spine lining, and the decoration is incidental to that function, being made possible only by their location. The joints of the stuck-on endband linings, which project beyond the width of the spine and which will be found on all examples until the mid-eighteenth century, were adhered to the outside of the boards up until the first half of the eighteenth century, after which they are more usually adhered to the inside of the boards. In this latter position, the projecting edges of the joints will often be trimmed back to the height of the bookblock. When worked with thread, the sewing follows the pattern of secondary endband sewing and the threads are not taken down into the gatherings, although it is also possible to find worked stuck-on endbands folded over cores where occasional tiedowns are taken down into the gatherings, thus forming a sort of hybrid endband (Szirmai, Fig. 9.30 (c)).
Stuck-on endbands are a German invention, and have been recorded from the mid-fifteenth century. They remained an exclusively German practice until the mid-eighteenth century, from which time examples of folded paper stuck-on endbands are found in most European countries except Britain, which seems only to have begun to use them in the early nineteenth century.</skos:scopeNote>
