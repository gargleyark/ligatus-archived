    <skos:scopeNote xml:lang="en">Small pieces of very thin sheet material that are adhered to the surface of a primary cover for decorated purposes. They will usually therefore be of a different colour than the primary cover but may also be made from a different material (e.g. paper on leather). Their use is most often combined with gold-tooling. They should not be confused with inlays.</skos:scopeNote>
