Brass is one of the most commonly-encountered copper alloys and is an alloy of copper and zinc, usually with copper as the major alloying element and zinc up to 40% by weight.

Both brass and bronze are therefore copper alloys, and unless the alloy is known, it is safer to call both of them copper alloys." , "@language" : "en" } ] }
