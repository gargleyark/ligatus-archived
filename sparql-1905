		"Paper which has been purposely given a relief texture with plates. The pattern created by the plates can either be metal-leaf embossed, where the metal leaf remains only in the depressions created by the raised parts of the plates (brocade paper), or blind-embossed, where a paper, uncoloured, already coloured or entirely covered with metal or colours is then simply embossed with the same type of plate (e.g. blind-embossed metallic paper)."@en .
